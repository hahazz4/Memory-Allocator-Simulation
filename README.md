# Memory Allocator Simulation

A memory allocator simulator that was made to mimic and display the behaviour of allocating and de-allocating blocks of memory (malloc(), free())

- **Simulated 1MB Memory Pool**
- **Custom `simMalloc()` and `simFree()`**
- **Block Splitting** – break larger blocks when allocating smaller chunks
- **Block Merging (Coalescing)** – combine adjacent free blocks
- **Manual Pointer Arithmetic**
- **Lightweight Benchmarking Support**
